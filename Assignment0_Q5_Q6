 Q6:
 I think GO is a nice programming language, it feels like I am writing a C program to be quite honest
 but without having to worry about allocating memory and deallocating it afterwards. I am quite surprised by the strong GO community
 there is lots of support for the GO language I found it easy to google all my questions and find tons of helpful resources.
 I will definitely consider using GO for some future side projects..
